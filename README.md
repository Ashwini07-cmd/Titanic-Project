### 3️⃣ Age vs Passenger Class (Boxplot)
The boxplot compares age distribution across passenger classes. First-class passengers tend to be older on average.

## 📈 Key Insights
- First-class passengers generally paid higher fares and were older.
- Third-class passengers had a lower median age.
- Female passengers showed higher survival rates.
- Fare is strongly related to passenger class.
- Most passengers traveled alone or with small families.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
The EDA reveals that socio-economic factors such as passenger class, fare, and gender played an important role in survival outcomes. 
This analysis provides a strong foundation for further predictive modeling.
